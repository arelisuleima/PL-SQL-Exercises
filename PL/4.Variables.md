**Variables ⭐**: They are used to store data and manipulate stored values. They can store any PL/SQL object such as variables, types, cursors, or subprograms. Variables can
include the characters `#` and `$`, as well as numbers and letters. Variables should not contain more than 30 characters. 

Here is an example of variable initialization:
```sql
DECLARE
v_myName VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN 
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('My name is: '||v_myName);
v_myName := 'John'; -->Here is variable inizialitation
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('My name is: '||v_myName);
END;

```
 🟥***Variable Declaration***: Variables must be declared within the `DECLARE` section, in the following way:
 ```SQL
 variable_name [CONSTANT] TYPE[NOT NULL][:=initialization];
 ```
Any variable that is declared but not initialized defaults to the value `NULL`. 
The data type of the variable is incorporated in the `TYPE` section, which includes all data types existing in SQL and some existing in PL/SQL.

 ➡️Another way to assign a value to a variable is by using the `INTO` clause of the `SELECT` statement, for example:
 
 ```sql
 SELECT COUNT(*) INTO xBillNum FROM bills;
 ```
- `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`: It is used to return a text string in the script result.
- `%ROWTYPE`: Represents a partial row, table or view.
    - Column names cannot be used as identifiers.
    - `NOT NULL` if the variable must have a value.
- `%TYPE`: Declares a constant or variable, element, parameter to be of the same data type as a previously declared parameter.
    - The exact type of the table column does not need to be known.
    - If the definition and/or column type of the table is changed, the variable type automatically changes at runtime.
In the declaration, if we have the variable 'y', for example, declared as type `CHAR`, we can declare another variable 'j' as follows:
```sql
J y%TYPE;
```
And the same happens when declaring a structure that already exists, for example a table that exists and we have previously declared:
```SQL
J employee%ROWTYPE;
--> J will have the same structure as the employee table.
```
