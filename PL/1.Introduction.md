## PL/SQL ✨

 >  ⭐ ***Advantages of PL/SQL***:

- **Integration of procedure constructs with SQL ✅**: When issuing an SQL command, it tells the database server what to do, but not how to do it. PL/SQL integrates SQL statements and their execution.
- **Improved performance ✅**: SQL statements can be combined into a single program unit.
- **Modular program development✅**: The basic unit of PL/SQL programs is blocks. Blocks can be in sequence or nested in other blocks.
- **Integration with tools✅**: It is integrated into Oracle tools such as Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports. This means that it processes statements and procedures and only transfers SQL statements to the database.
- **Portability✅**: Portable program packages can be written and libraries can be created that can be reused in different environments.
- **Exception handling✅**: PL/SQL shares the same data type system as SQL (only with some extensions) and uses the same expression syntax.
>  ⭐**Data types**:
Similarly to SQL, PL/SQL uses the same data types. These data types can be used to `DECLARE` variables or in c`ursors to define the data type of each variable within the established parameters.

There are **scalar types** that, depending on the use of the variables and the data we are going to enter, we will establish their length, size or scale (in the case of numbers).

We also have composite types, which are compound data types that we can manipulate within the database using keywords. The most common example is `TABLE`, which, with the help of DDL statements, allows us to modify the data that is stored within it. Data can be `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE` within this type of data, and it can also be queried directly from the server's graphical interface.

Next, we have `DATE` types that allow us to use data of the type `DATE`, with all the variations offered by the database such as time zone indicator, time, local time, seconds, minutes, etc.
