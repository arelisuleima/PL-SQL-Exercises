## Programming Constructs ‚≠ê

**Tool constructs**:

üü•***Anonymous Blocks***: Unnamed SQL/PLSQL blocks that are embedded in an
application or issued interactively.
Example: The anonymous block retrieves the `first_name` of the employee
whose `employee_id` is *100* and stores it in a variable named `v_fname`.
```sql
declare
v_fname varchar(20);
begin
select first_name into v_fname from employees
where employee_id = 100;
end;

```
1. To execute our anonymous block, click on the Run Script button (<img width="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/arelisuleima/SQL-and-PL-SQL/assets/72313215/bd8f87aa-df45-4d82-8f62-fa589e0d54e9">
 ) or press F5.
2. To enable output in SQL Developer, execute the following command before running the PL/SQL block: `SET SERVEROUTPUT ON`
3. Use a pre-defined package by Oracle and its procedure in the anonymous block:
```sql
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee first name is: ' || v_fname);
```
4. Use the above as shown below:
 ```sql
 declare
v_fname varchar(20);
begin
select first_name into v_fname from employees
where employee_id = 100;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee first name is: ' || v_fname);
end;

 
```
