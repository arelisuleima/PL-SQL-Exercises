 ## Building Blocks in PL/SQL ⭐ 
**PL/SQL** is a structured language with blocks. Each PL/SQL block is defined by the keywords `DECLARE`, `BEGIN`, `EXCEPTION`, and `END`, which divide the block into three sections:

- **Declarative**: Statements that declare variables, constants, and other code elements that can be used within the block.
- **Executable**: Executable statements.
- **Exception handling**: A structured section for handling any exceptions that occur during the execution of the executable section. It is not necessary to declare it in the block or handle the exceptions that may be thrown.
```sql
begin
dbms_output.put_line('Hello!');
end;
```
🟥**Variables**: They are used to store data and manipulate stored values.
- They can store any PL/SQL value such as variables, types, cursors, or subprograms.
- The characters $ and # are allowed, they should not have more than 30 characters, and can include letters or numbers.

🟥 **Handling of variables**:
- They can be declared anywhere in the block.
- They can be assigned an initial value and impose a NOT NULL constraint.
- Their values can be replaced.
- The assignment operator is `‘:=’`.
- If a delimiter (`! !, [], ‘ ’`) is desired, it is used to initialize the string.
> ***Block Structure***:
`DECLARE`: Variables, cursors, defined exceptions.
`BEGIN`: SQL and PL/SQL statements.
`EXCEPTION`: Actions to be taken when exceptions occur.
`END`: Mandatory.

🟥**Types of blocks**: There are three types of blocks that make up a PL/SQL program.

- **Procedures**: These are named objects that contain SQL and/or PL/SQL statements.
- *Procedures* can include input parameters (`IN`).
- To execute or extract them, the `EXTRACT` function or a `BEGIN` statement is used. In the case of parameters, a input parameter is given to the base and the table is updated if new data is added to the new table.
- **Functions**: These are named objects that contain SQL and/or PL/SQL statements. Unlike procedures, functions return a value of a specific data type.
- **Anonymous blocks**: These are nameless blocks. They are declared at the point in an application where they are to be executed and are compiled each time an application is executed. These blocks are not stored in the database.

🟥**Subprograms**: Subprograms complement anonymous blocks. They are named PL/SQL blocks stored in the database.
