Hello!üê∏ Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'll be sharing some SQL and PL/SQL codes. In this repository, you'll find a variety of scripts and queries that I have created to solve different problems related to databases and data management systems.

These codes can be useful for those who are learning SQL and PL/SQL or for those who are looking for solutions to specific problems in their projects. Moreover, you can also use these codes as a starting point to create your own solutions.

I hope that these codes will be helpful to you and feel free to use and modify them according to your needs üòä. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my repository! ü§ó
