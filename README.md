**SQL and PL/SQL for Beginners** 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72313215/228310719-050fae75-fbca-424d-8e1a-f0ece06cb404.png" width="100" height="100" />

Hello!🐸 Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'll be sharing some SQL and PL/SQL codes. In this repository, you'll find a variety of scripts and queries that I have created to solve different problems related to databases and data management systems.

These codes can be useful for those who are learning `SQL and PL/SQL` or for those who are looking for solutions to specific problems in their projects. Moreover, you can also use these codes as a starting point to create your own solutions.

> For these practices, the version of **Oracle SQL Developer 12c** was used.

I hope that these codes will be helpful to you and feel free to use and modify them according to your needs 😊. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my repository! 🤗

**HR Schema**

The  `HR diagram` refers to the example data model provided by Oracle in its database for educational and testing purposes. This data model is frequently used to demonstrate how different tables can be created and related in a relational database using the SQL language.

> The HR data model includes several tables such as: `Employees👷🏻‍♀️`, `Departments🏢`, `Jobs🔨` , `Locations🌆` and `Countries🏙️`, each representing a different entity or concept within a company. For example, the `Employees` table contains information about each employee, such as their **name**, **ID number**, and **salary**, while the `Departments` table includes information about the different departments in a company, such as the sales department or the marketing department.

Each table in the HR model has a  **primary key 🔑** that is used to uniquely identify each record in the table. Additionally, there are **foreign keys 🔐** that are used to establish relationships between tables. For example, the "Employees" table has a foreign key that relates to the "Departments" table, indicating which department each employee works in.

The Oracle SQL HR diagram visually shows how the different tables in the HR model are related. The diagram provides information about the tables, their columns, and their relationships. Rectangles represent the tables, while the lines between them represent the relationships between the tables.

In summary, the Oracle SQL HR diagram is a visual representation of the example data model provided by Oracle in its database. It is a useful tool for understanding how different tables can be created and related in a relational database using the SQL language.
